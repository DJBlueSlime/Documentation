= Editing commits

Do you have the problem that you mispelled some letter or word on a commit message? Well, then I will give you a small but very useful tip.

= The problem

[source, terminal]
----
$ git commit -m "Updayed README.md" && git push
----

"NOOOOOOOOO", That feeling when you see that you mispelled a letter an already pushed it.

= The solution

Well, that is horrible, but fortunately there is a solution.

Behold, the solution:

[source, terminal]
----
$ git commit --amend -m "Updated README.md" && git push
----

If you now run:

[source, terminal]
----
$ git log
----

You will see the message spelled correctly.

If you want to change the author, the date or even the gpg key which signed the commit, you can.

= Changing author

To change the author of a commit run:

[source, terminal]
----
$ git commit --amend --author "{[<name>]} {[<email>]}"
----

= Changing date

To change the date of a commit, run:

[source, terminal]
----
$ git commit --amend --date "<day> <month> <number of day> <hh:mm:ss>"
----

= Changing gpg key

To change the gpg key of the commit, run:

[source, terminal]
----
$ git commit --amend -S -gpg-sign={[<key-id>]}
----
