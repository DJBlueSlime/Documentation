# Intro

Go is a language that people uses (obviusly), but I want to call Go a "Terminal Language", because it only runs from terminal, similar to python. Go is backed by Google, so you can trust them.

# The very basics

In almost every language the most basic thing are variables, then types of variables, then functions, and so on.

## Variables

In Go the variables are... kinda special, in other languages like JavaScript you define a variable like this:

```javascript
var name = "John"
```

In Go you can define variables in 2 ways. First one:

```go
name := "John"
```

Yeah, pretty different from JavaScript, Also note the ':'. Second one:

```go
var name = "John"
var age int
```

Yeah, that looks similar to JavaScript. In second line we see:

```go
var age int
```

Why? Well it's to define variables with no value, 'var' indicates that is a variable, 'age' is the variable name and 'int' defines the type of the variable.
